                <p>To make an espresso, shoot boiling water under high pressure through finely ground up coffee beans
                    and then pour into a tiny mug. Sounds simple right? Well, it’s surprisingly difficult to master.
                    Espressos are the purest coffee experience you can get, and while they’re not for everyone, it can
                    be a truly singular drinking experience when you find a good brew.</p>

                <p>Possibly the most popular type of coffee in the world, a cappuccino consists of three layers (kind of
                    like a cake). The first is a shot of espresso, then a shot of steamed milk, and finally the barista
                    adds a layer of frothed, foamy milk. This final layer can also be topped with chocolate shavings or
                    powder. Traditionally, Italians would consume this type of coffee at breakfast.</p>

                <p>You can make this type of coffee quite simply by adding hot water to a shot of espresso coffee. It
                    has been said that American soldiers during the Second World War would make this type of coffee to
                    make their beverages last longer. It was then (apparently) adopted by American baristas after the
                    war.</p>

                <p>A fairly popular option for coffee drinkers, a latte consists steamed (or scolded) milk and a single
                    shot of coffee. It is usually quite frothy, and you’ll occasionally encounter cafes that don’t
                    understand the difference between this and a flat white.</p>
